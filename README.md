# shell
shell scripts

hosts:
  My hosts with many entries.
  Ideal to protect your phone from google and block nonsensical websites.

dpkg-get-set-selection.sh:
  With dpkg, you can set which packages are to be installed/removed etc.

Open-GSI-Image :
  Opens an AOSP/lineage/...whatever.img and opens nemo. In it you can make changes and write back to an image.

InstallAppFromF-DroidViaADB:
  Downloads the index from the repo in F-Droid, searches for current apks and installs them via adb.

Gif2Android-Bootanimation:
  This can turn almost any gif into an Android (lineage) compliant boot animation.

Flash Script GSI with fastboot or adb:
  The script opens a GSI image, deletes apps and copies custom apps to the system, replaces the hosts and a custom boot animation. The new image is installed with fastboot or copied to the sd-card via adb.
